# Portfolio_Analyzer
This module was created for these main purposes: portfolio rebalancing with minimization of volatility and maximization of the Sharpe ratio and quick presentation of portfolio's perfomance. And it does it quickly.

You can also get metrics for your portfolio in one line:
- Total Return of portfolio
- Annualized Return
- Annualized Volatility 
- Alpha
- Beta
- Value at Risk (historical)
- Sharpe Ratio (before re-balancing)
- Sharpe Ratio (after re-balancing)
- Sortino Ratio
- Treynor Ratio

To clone it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vsaraikin/Portfolio_Analyzer
```
For checking out the results open the "test.ipynb"
